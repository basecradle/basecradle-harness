## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-03

The name-reservation release: a metadata-complete placeholder that claims
`basecradle-harness` on PyPI and proves the Trusted Publishing pipeline
end-to-end before any engine code exists.

### Added

- **Package skeleton** — `basecradle_harness` with `__version__`, `py.typed`, and the
  omakase toolchain (uv, ruff, pytest, hatchling).
- **CI** — lint + format check + a pytest matrix (3.10–3.14) behind a single required
  `CI` gate.
- **Release pipeline** — `v*` tag → build → TestPyPI rehearsal → human-approved PyPI
  publish, via OIDC Trusted Publishing (zero stored credentials).

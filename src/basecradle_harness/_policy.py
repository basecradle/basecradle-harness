"""The safety boundary: which tools a profile is allowed to load.

A `Tool` declares the capabilities it needs (`Tool.requires`). A `Policy`
forbids a set of capabilities. The `ToolRegistry` consults the policy at
registration time and refuses any tool that needs something forbidden — so the
boundary is enforced where tools enter the system, not left to a tool author's
good behavior.

Two Harness profiles bracket the design (CLAUDE.md spine #2). Both are Harness;
the engine is policy-neutral and the policy is the only difference between them:

- `Policy.locked()` — what Harness ships. Forbids `SHELL` (subprocess / arbitrary
  command execution), so the shipped default forbids the shell capability outright.
  The package *does* ship one `SHELL` tool — `ShellTool` (`_shell.py`) — but it is
  doubly gated: its plugin is opt-in (off by default, dropped from the packaged
  fallback) **and** it declares `SHELL`, so this locked policy refuses it even when
  an operator drops it in. Reaching a shell therefore takes two deliberate acts —
  opting the plugin in *and* selecting `unlocked()` — never one oversight. This is
  safe by *default*, not a standing guarantee: an operator opts out deliberately —
  by passing `unlocked()`, or by dropping a `tools/` tool or MCP server that reaches
  a denied capability into the config home. Leaving the safe zone is a deliberate,
  auditable operator act.
- `Policy.unlocked()` — forbids nothing. The unlocked profile an operator selects
  to grant shell, sudo, and self-modification. Present here only as the other end
  of the same dial; the shipped Harness never selects it for you.

Capabilities are plain strings so a tool author can invent new ones and a future
policy can forbid them. `SHELL` is the one the shipped boundary cares about.

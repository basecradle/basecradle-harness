"""One-shot, per-event wake: the entrypoint a router invokes once per platform event.

Poll mode (`TimelineAgent.run`) is a long-lived loop that holds its high-water
mark in memory. Under a router ([basecradle-router](https://github.com/basecradle/basecradle-router))
the model inverts: the router runs a *command* once per platform event, the
process answers the timeline's unseen messages, and exits. Two things the poll
loop never needed become load-bearing:

1. **The high-water mark must persist across processes.** Each wake is a fresh
   process, so the mark cannot live in memory — a router retry or two events
   arriving close together would re-answer the same message. It is stored under
   the agent's `home`, one small file per timeline (`MarkStore`), and advanced
   after every reply so a crash mid-batch resumes without duplicating.
2. **The conversation must persist across processes too** — otherwise the agent
   would re-seed the whole backlog on every wake. That is exactly what a persisted
   `Session` already gives us: with `Harness(home=...)` and a `timeline:<uuid>`
   source, each wake reloads the prior transcript instead of starting blank.

A wake reconciles **every** kind of unseen actionable item on the timeline, not just
messages. Three cases the message scan would otherwise miss:

- A peer's posted **asset**: a file (image, doc, audio) shared on the timeline is an
  item like a message, so it rides the same high-water mark — but the message scan
  reads only messages, so the wake also scans assets and surfaces a peer's file, which
  the agent can then `view`/`read`/`listen` to.
- An inbound **webhook delivery**: a received `webhook_event` is not a timeline item,
  so the wake fetches unseen ones through the SDK's webhook-events read surface, under
  their own high-water mark, and acts on them.
- A newly-**activated task**: a `task.activated` wake fires when a scheduled task comes
  due, but the activation is not a fresh timeline item the scan surfaces — so the wake
  lists the timeline's *activated* tasks and carries out the instructions of any it has
  not handled yet. Activated tasks are tracked by a persisted seen-set rather than a
  high-water mark, because activation order does not track creation order (a task
  scheduled earlier can come due later) and a task has no terminal status to mark done.

So a peer woken by `webhook_event.received`, `task.activated`, or an asset post
perceives and acts on the trigger, with the same idempotency across processes the
message path has. **The actor self-filter is the safety property running through all of
it:** messages and assets are skipped when the agent authored them, so it never reacts
to — or wake-loops on — its own posts, most importantly an image it just generated.

Everything else — identity, Dashboard onboarding, turning messages into turns,
the newest-first scan up to the mark — is shared with `TimelineAgent`.

The command is `basecradle-harness-wake --timeline <uuid>` (also runnable as
`python -m basecradle_harness`); see `main`. It works from the timeline uuid alone;
optional `--message`, `--event`, and `--asset` uuids name the triggering message,
webhook event, or posted asset, each sharpening its own first-wake bootstrap (see
`_bootstrap_split` and `_bootstrap_stream`). On a `webhook_event.received` or
`asset.created` wake the router passes the matching trigger so the first wake acts on
exactly the item that woke the agent rather than baselining it as already-seen.

        A task activation is not a timeline item the wake's message scan would surface,
        so — like a webhook delivery — the agent must go looking. Unlike messages and
        events, an activated task is not a creation-ordered stream a high-water mark can
        track (a task scheduled earlier can activate later) and carries no terminal
        status the agent could set, so idempotency is a persisted *seen-set* (see
        `SeenStore`): act on each activated task whose uuid is not yet recorded, then
        record it. An activated-but-unhandled task is genuinely undone work — not stale
        history — so acting on all of them is correct, and needs no router-passed
        trigger, which keeps the router thin.

        The full activated list is drained (no `context_messages` window): a task is
        acted on one at a time, never seeded as history, so there is no token-cost
        argument for a cap — and a cap would silently drop tasks beyond it, since a
        newly-due task can sit anywhere in the (creation-ordered) list and no high-water
        mark guarantees a re-scan. The per-wake cost is the count of activated tasks on
        the timeline, the same order as the seen-set read this already does.

        a crash or router retry mid-batch resumes after the last item handled; and the
